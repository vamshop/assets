## Usage

Once activated successfully, three new buttons (Reload, Browse, and Upload)

pages: Nodes, Blocks, and Types.

Clicking on the "Upload" button will bring up a popup window, where you can
select and upload the asset file.

When ticking the "Featured Image" checkbox, the asset will be automatically
grouped under the "Featured Image" record.

A simple helper method (AssetsImageHelper::featured) is included for basic
markup generation.

	* Local Attachment
